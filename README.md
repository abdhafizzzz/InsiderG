To extend the width of the author column and ensure that long author names are displayed properly without wrapping or overlapping with other content, you can use CSS to control the column width and handle text overflow. Here's an example of how you can modify the code:

```html
<td style="width: 200px; white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;">
    {{ $todolist->user->name }}
</td>
```

In the code above, the `style` attribute is added to the `<td>` element to control its width and handle text overflow. Here's what each CSS property does:

- `width: 200px;` sets the width of the column to 200 pixels. You can adjust this value based on your desired width.

- `white-space: nowrap;` prevents the text from wrapping to the next line. This ensures that the author name remains on a single line.

- `overflow: hidden;` hides any content that exceeds the width of the column.

- `text-overflow: ellipsis;` adds an ellipsis (`...`) at the end of the text if it overflows the column width.

By applying these CSS properties to the author column (`<td>`), long author names will be truncated with an ellipsis, ensuring that they don't break the layout and allowing users to still see the complete name by hovering over the truncated text.

Feel free to adjust the width and other CSS properties as needed to achieve the desired appearance.
